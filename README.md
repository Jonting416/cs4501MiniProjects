# cs4501MiniProjects
Projects done for Programming Languages for Web Applications at UVa, done in Javascript, PHP, and HTML/CSS.  Projects use flat files or mySQL backend for saving, and were tested with XAMP as a local server.

The projects are as follows:
1. A quiz of the day web-application built using PHP that lets you get a new quiz each day using cookies.  It draws from a flat file bank of questions, and keeps statistics on how you perform.
2. A ticket system built using PHP and mySQL to contain the ticketing information.  This site keeps track of ticketing data, and lets the user sort and filter by specific conditions.
3. The same ticketing system as 2, except improved by adding AJAX so the browser doesn't have to refresh as often.
4. A hangman game in the browser implemented with jQuery.  Has rudimentary stat tracking as long as the page is not refreshed.
